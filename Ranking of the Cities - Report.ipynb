Traveling is a passion and also a curiosity for many people, because they want to discover either traditions, different lifestyles, new places, new environments and especially new horizons. "

    "Before any traveling, a research must be done. Depending on people, money can be a problem, so they investigate cheaper flights and cheaper stays. Based on that and their income, they choose a city to visit, but it takes a long time to find a desirable place. Travel guides often include a brief description about every city, including prices, places to visit, restaurants to eat and many more. But, what they don't include is a city ranking. A short briefing about every popular city depending on what you want to visit. "

As a filter for this problem, a ranking of the cities can be done so travelers can ease their research to even a third. In this ranking will be included the global score of the city, the score of touring (tourism), relaxation, sociability and sportiveness. Every tourist wants to know if the next city break that they will make will have everything they need and they want to know that broadly speaking, not doing so much research to begin with.       "

    "The data that will be used is from Foursquare API. By getting the venues related to Tourism, for example: Hotels, Motels, Monuments, Museums, Airports, it's possible to know how well much you are going to enjoy your city break in that city, having lots of places to visit and a lot of options for Hotels and more. After counting all the places that are related to Tourism from all the cities that get in this ranking system, then a score is computed for every city, by normalizing the numbers from the maximum to the minimum. Same goes for the other scores. A global score will have the same principle, but will be formed by the scores from tourism, relaxation, sociability and sportiveness (with their corresponding weights as well). 0.4 for Tourism, 0.2 for Sociability, 0.3 for Relaxation and 0.1 for Sportiveness. These numbers are chosen so that the global score reflects more about wanting to travel to that city than how good that city performs for their citizen. That's why the population factor wasn't taken into consideration. The data gathered is taken from the center of every the city in a range of 20 kilometers. This way, even the biggest cities are covered. Only 20 cities were covered in this ranking, because Foursquare API has limited calls. Limitations occurred even at requesting venues. That's why multiple top cities have the same number of places, thus the same ranking."

    "From the ranking above we can clearly see that New York City is the greatest for traveling and not just that. While, at the bottom, we have Kabul City, the capital of Afghanistan. Moscow entered in the bottom cities because it does not have a lot of touristic places, rather than a few must visit locations. We can consider this an error for our ranking taking into consideration that Sofia and Bucharest are above. There are a lot to discuss about this ranking and a lot to improve. But given the limited API, the results are quite astonishing and pretty accurate. A major upgrade to this ranking is by grouping cities after their population per square meter by using a clustering method. I believe that it will give more accurate results. In conclusion, applying the well known fact that every machine learning algorithm needs a lot of data for training to have good results, we can say that this is a small step to something bigger. "
